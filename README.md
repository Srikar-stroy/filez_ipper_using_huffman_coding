# File-zipper-using-Huffman-Coding

This project is called "File Zipper." It's a software application designed to make files smaller by using a special technique called the Huffman coding algorithm. When you have lots of digital files, they can take up a lot of space, making it difficult to store and share them. File Zipper helps solve this problem by squeezing the files down, so they use less space while keeping all their important information intact.

The project aims to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for people from various industries to use. The application can compress different types of files like text documents, images, making it versatile and useful for many purposes.
