# File Zipper with Huffman Encoding Project

This project implements a File Zipper using Huffman Encoding for text, PDF, and image files. It utilizes a combination of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Flask framework.

## Features

- **Huffman Encoding:** The project uses the Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress files efficiently, reducing their size while preserving data integrity.

- **Support for Multiple File Types:** The zipper can compress and decompress various file types, including text files, PDFs, and image files.

- **Web Interface:** The project offers a user-friendly web interface to upload files, compress them using Huffman encoding, and download the compressed files.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The project uses HTML to structure the web interface, creating a user-friendly layout for file upload and download.

- **CSS:** CSS is employed for styling the web interface, ensuring an appealing and responsive design.

- **JavaScript:** The interactive elements of the web interface are implemented using JavaScript, providing seamless user experience.

- **Python:** Python is used to implement the Huffman encoding algorithm and handle file compression and decompression.

- **Flask Framework:** The project is built with the Flask framework to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and integrate Python back-end with the front-end web interface.
